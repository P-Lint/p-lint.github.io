<h1>P-Lint: Detecting Permission Smells</h1>

<p>Android is built upon a permission-based structure, where apps require access to specific permissions in order to carry out specific functionality. While Android has provided a set of best practices intended to aide the developer in properly using these permissions, developers frequently do not adhere to these guidelines. Although some of the resulting issues may be minor and lead to slight user confusion, while other mistakes may create more serious privacy and security related issues. We've defined improper usage of these permission best practices to be `permission smells' to indicate possible permissions related issues and have created a tool known as P-Lint to help assist with discovering these smells. P-Lint will not only help developers create better, more secure apps by providing guidance on properly using permissions, but will allow researchers to perform an empirical analysis on existing apps.</p>
