<h3>Permission Smells</h3>
<p>P-Lint discovers <i>Permission Smells</i> as defined by the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/best-practices.html" target="_blank">Android best practices</a> guide. Many of these smells are defined below:



<h4>Application Targets</h4>
<ul>
<li>{uncompressedAPK}/app/AndroidManifest.xml: Looking for information specific to APK that is found here (Use cases: 2, 3, 4, 8-16)</li>
<li>{uncompressedAPK}/app/src/android/support/v4: Searching through java files for specific use cases. Using this directory as it seems to be where relevant app controlling java files are stored. (Use cases: 1, 5, 6, 7)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Use Cases</h4>
<li><b>Use case 1:</b> Searching for instances of the method call “shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale” in java files (Good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 2:</b> Searching for dangerous permission CAMERA that could be replaced by an intent using Android’s camera application (Not bad or good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 3:</b> Searching through manifest for dangerous permission SEND_SMS that could possibly be replaced by an intent using Android’s existing messaging service (Not bad or good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 4:</b> Searching through manifest for dangerous permission CALL_PHONE that could possibly be replaced by an intent using Android’s existing phone application (Not bad or good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 5:</b> APK does NOT initialize checkSelfPermission method even if permission requests are made (Bad)</li>
<li><b>Use case 6:</b> APK does initialize checkSelfPermission method when permission requests are made (Good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 7:</b> Checks to see if multiple permission requests are made in close proximity in the code, possibly overwhelming user with requests (Bad)</li>
<li><b>Use case 8:</b> Custom permission is declared in manifest, could fail depending on its dependencies to dangerous permissions if they’re not granted (Not good or bad)</li>
<li><b>Use case 9:</b>  Permission declaration has a min SDK version set below 23, and no max SDK version. (Check that it works for BOTH permission models)</li>
<li><b>Use case 10:</b> Permission declaration has min SDK version below 23 and max SDK version at or above 23 (Good)</li>
<li><b>Use case 11:</b> Permission declaration has min SDK version at or above 23 (Should check how this permission is handled/used in older versions)</li>
<li><b>Use case 12:</b> Permission declaration has max SDK version below 23 (should check to see how permission behavior occurs on new model)</li>
<li><b>Use case 13:</b> Permission declaration has max SDK version at or above 23, but no min. SDK version (should check to see how it functions in old model)</li>
<li><b>Use case 14:</b> APK’s min SDK version is below 23, and max SDK version is at or above 23 (Should check how it functions on BOTH models)</li>
<li><b>Use case 15:</b> APK’s max SDK version is below 23 (Does not follow M-Permission model, disregard the results for this APK)</li>
<li><b>Use case 16:</b> APK’s min SDK version is at or above 23 (Only needs to check that it adheres to M-Permission model)</li>
